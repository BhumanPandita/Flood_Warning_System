### FLOOD WARNING FORECASTING

Flood Warning systems using machine learning algorithms

This project focuses on flood prediction in the state of Kerala.

The objective is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the occurrence of floods based on 
various features, such as monthly and annual rainfall index. The project explores six algorithms:
1)Logistic Regression,
2)K-Nearest Neighbors
3)Decision Trees
4)Random Forests
5)Naive Bayes
6)Support Vector Machines. 

By comparing the performance of these algorithms, we aim to identify the most effective approach
for flood prediction in Kerala.

The project begins with data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and feature selection.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the features are appropriately scaled and encoded.
Each algorithm uses R programming language and relevant packages such as class, 
readxl, ggplot2, caTools, glmnet, and e1071. The code for each algorithm is provided.
